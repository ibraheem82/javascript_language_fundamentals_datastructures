// *  Assignment 1

// 1. Declare variables called 'country', 'continent' and 'population' and.
// assign their values according to your own country (population in millions).
// 2. Log their values to the console.
// ASSIGNMENT 2
// 3. Declare a variable called 'isIsland' and set its value according to your
// country. The variable should hold a Boolean value. Also declare a variable
// 'language', but don't assign it any value yet
// 4. Log the types of 'isIsland', 'population', 'country' and 'language'
// to the console
// 5. Set the value of 'language' to the language spoken where you live (some
// countries have multiple languages, but just choose one)
// 6. Think about which variables should be const variables (which values will never
// change, and which might change?). Then, change these variables to const.
// 7. Try to change one of the changed variables now, and observe what happens.
